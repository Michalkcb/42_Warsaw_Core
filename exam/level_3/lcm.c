Write a function who takes two unsigned int as parameters and returns the
computed LCM of those parameters.

LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of two non-zero integers is the smallest postive
integer divisible by the both integers.

A LCM can be calculated in two ways:

- You can calculate every multiples of each integers until you have a common
multiple other than 0

- You can use the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of these two integers and
calculate as follows:

	LCM(x, y) = | x * y | / HCF(x, y)

  | x * y | means "Absolute value of the product of x by y"

If at least one integer is null, LCM is equal to 0.

Your function must be prototyped as follows:

  unsigned int    lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);
  */

 unsigned int lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)
 {
	unsigned int n;
	if (a == 0 || b == 0)
		return 0;
	if (a > b)
		n = a;
	else
		n = b;
	while (1)
	{
		if (n % a == 0 && n % b == 0)
			return (n);
		n++;
	}
 }

/*
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
 int main(int ac, char *av[])
 {
	if (ac == 3)
	{
		unsigned int a = atoi(av[1]);
		unsigned int b = atoi(av[2]);
		printf("%u\n", lcm(a,b));
	}
	return 0;
 }
